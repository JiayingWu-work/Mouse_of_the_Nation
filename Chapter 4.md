Chapter IV: The Fall of the Kingdom 

The mouse bigger the largest man in the city returned to the city gates
looking hungry.

The mouse having ate all of their stockpiles left the people starving. The only way out seems to be to slay the mouse.

"Mom, I'm hungry. Can you make me food?" said an 8-yr-old little girl who has not eaten anything for 8 days.

"Oh, my daughter. I am so sorry. I want to make food but the mouse took everything away. Maybe if the archers can get the mouse, we can eat some mouse stew." the mom cried, in guilt. 

A day later, people found the daughter and mom, hugged each other, died in peace. 

There was no hope for the nation.
