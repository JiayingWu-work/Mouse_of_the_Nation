Chapter IV: The Fall of the Kingdom 

The mouse is growing bigger and bigger â€“ it is definitely a threat to the kingdom because it eats some food from the peopel 
in the kingdom. People are starving but have no way to eliminate that mouse. It is too hugh! 

"Mom, I'm hungry. Can you make me food?" said an 8-yr-old little girl who has not eaten anything for 8 days.

"Oh, my daughter. I am so sorry. I want to make food but the mouse took everything away." the mom cried, in guilt. 

A day later, people found the daughter and mom, hugged each other, died in peace.
